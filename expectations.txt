Santos, Justin Roy B.
CMSC 100 EF-1L

Expectations:
I am expecting that this couse will be hard as some of my classmates said that they are
currently retaking this course.
Some even said that this is their nth time taking this course, and many of them dropped this 
course during the pandemic and some in last semester.

So with that info, I am expecting this course to be very hard, probably even harder than the
CMSC courses I have taken last school year.

However, it seems that sir Carl is very kind and discusses the lessons well so I hope that that
sir Carl will guide and help us to pass this course.

In addition to that, since I knew now that this course is very hard, I need to do some extra
work to pass this course.

I should follow tutorials on the internet about the lessons to make sure that I could keep up with
the class and to hopefully pass this course.
